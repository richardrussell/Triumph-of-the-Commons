Triumph of the Commons

Immediately following the riots in London and other cities in August 2011, many people self-organised to clean up the mess that was left. They used websites and social networks to co-ordinate and ended up being the good news story to counter the negativity of the riots themselves. Triumph of the Commons is about capturing this spirit and harnessing it for the long term.
